# Tasks with file system, hash, compress, decompress implemented with both relative and absolute paths.
## Important!
Since, support for relative and absolute path, according to the file manager assignments was required only for cd task, I implemented solution with relative path from main index js file.
For example:
cat ./some_directory/some_file - with relative path
cat /absolute_path/some_file - with absolute path
